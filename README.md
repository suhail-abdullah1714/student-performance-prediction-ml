# Student Performance Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts student academic performance based on study-related factors using machine learning techniques.

## Objective
To analyze student data and build a machine learning model that predicts final scores based on hours studied, attendance, and previous performance.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:
- Hours_Studied
- Attendance
- Previous_Score
- Final_Score (Target)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Machine Learning Model
- Linear Regression

## Steps Involved
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Feature selection
3. Train-test split
4. Model training
5. Model evaluation using R² score

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `python model.py`

## Output
The model outputs the R² score to evaluate prediction performance.
